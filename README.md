# Calibration

1. Adjust colors (HSV) until detection is correct and reliable (i.e. excluding background).
2. Position yourself centered in front of your camera.
3. Point at the center of the screen (the real world screen, not in the video).
4. Adjust nudges so that the green cross matches up with the pink one.
5. Point at the top edge of the physical screen and adjust the vertical stretch factor so that the horizontal green line touches the top edge of the virtual screen.
6. Point at the right edge of the physical screen and adjust the horizontal stretch factor so that the vertical green line touches the right edge of the virtual screen.
